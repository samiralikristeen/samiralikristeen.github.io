<h2> All About Samirali 💌🎧📖</h2>
  <p> Hi! My name is Samirali and I'm a 17 year old aspiring law student. In my free time, I enjoy working at a non-profit I joined this summer named YVote! I work an internship for them as part of their Social Media Creator Corps! Check out their page on Instagram (@yvoteny) every Monday to see my posts. I also run a book account of my own on Instagram (@samiralistories). I post a plethora of book related content including reels, reviews, reccomendations, and more. Reading is one of my favorite hobbies that I adopted in the last year, and I find a great deal of escapism through libraries and bookstores. In the midst of finding new hobbies this summer, I discovered something new I enjoyed, journaling. I've been writing in my journal and then collaging related photos with the words. I enjoy taking photos and exploring the city, which I do quite often with friends. The extent of my hobbies are mostly all related to reading, writing, and social media content creation, whether for my internship at YVote or for my own book account. </p>

  <h2> My Future </h2>
  <p> As long as I've remembered I wanted a career in law. At first, I had an interest in forensic pathology, utnil one hospital visit and a lot of blood later, I realized my stomach was not cut out for the job. I turned my attention away from the scalpel and to the courtroom. Countless nights I spent watching true crime documentaries, hearing court cases, reading about murders and trials have molded my goals in life. Becoming a prosecutor and having my own law firm is a big dream, but not unnatainable. In addition to reaching my dreams of being a high profile lawyer, I would like to continue my activism journey throughout my adulthood. No matter how far I get in my career, I will never forget about or lose my passion for fighting for marginalized groups. I have a huge heart for activism that will be with me until I can no longer voice my opinions. I've considered possibly becoming a political figure later in my career, but haven't decided whether I can handle being professional in the face of bigotry. I hope to continue working with non-profits to evoke small-scale and large-scale change. </p>

<h2> Friends <3 </h2>
<p> Though it took some time, I found the best group of friend I could have ever asked for! I love them so much and appreciate all they do for me. Although this page is about me, I do feel the need to add my friends to this. They have not only shaped who I am as a person, but showed who I want to be one day Picnics, city adventures, after school hangouts, weekend trips, and so many memories with such amazing, kind hearted people. There's no one else I'd rather spend my senior year with. Here's a collection of photos!</p>
