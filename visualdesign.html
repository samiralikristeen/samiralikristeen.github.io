Using Adobe Express, I utilized their flyer layout to give my images a symmetrical and cohesive vision. I embody light feminine academia, the academia represented by the symmetrical structure of the photos. In addition to it being my favorite color, my use of pink symbolized hyperfemininity, a traditionally demonized style. The bright pink, flowers, detailed architecture, and hairbows are all representations of traditional femininity, which is the aesthetic I resonate most with. Women are taught to reject hyperfemininity with age, due to the media portraying it not only as a symbol of low intelligence, but also as high maintenance and self absorbed, both being undesirable traits in the eyes of men. It is because of this portrayal that I am attracted to this aesthetic, which inspired my collage. Libraries and books would typically contrast this aesthetic, but my use of them in relation to beauty and femininity changes what it means to be hyperfeminine. <br>

<br> In creating my 8 bit design, I decided to use my likeness as the character is inspired by me. I gave my character long brown curly hair, but with pink highlights. She is supposed to have a renegade, fighter, rebel look that defies gender norms, as she is also a princess. My character is wearing a purple ball gown and tiara, juxtaposed with her pink highlights and pink sword. The princessâ€™s purpose is to save the villagers of her kingdom as a lucrative knight, a royal by day, hero by night.
